Today I've released version 0.12 of [Idle Garden](https://jalamb5.itch.io/idle-garden). Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s new in this update:

### Introduction of Levels
The biggest feature in this update is the introduction of levels! Now, as you play, youâ€™ll progress through different levels (based upon your score, introduced in the [last major update](https://blog.justinlamb.org/2024/07/24/Devlog-Score-Idle-Garden/)), unlocking new features along the way. For this first iteration there are 4 levels which unlock the various automations, expect more levels in the future.

### Visual Indicators
Iâ€™ve added a small visual indicator on the display to notify players of changes. This should make it easier to see when something in your inventory or garden changes.

### Save
The save button has now moved to the top of the sidebar. I wanted this to be a bit less intrusive so I also changed to an icon rather than text. Longer term, I expect this will become a pause button instead that will bring up the option to save, adjust game volume, etc.

Thatâ€™s all for this update! Stay tuned for more updates.

Happy gardening! ðŸŒ¼
