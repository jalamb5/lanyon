Hey everyone! Version 0.17 of [Idle Garden](https://jalamb5.itch.io/idle-garden) is now live, bringing several major updates and improvements.

### Garden Shed
The biggest addition in this update is the introduction of the Garden Shed. The shed is where your harvested plants and seeds will now be stored. You can sell your harvest directly from the shed and purchase more seeds. A key change here is that plant and seed types are now differentiated. Previously, red flowers and blue flowers shared the same seed and were planted at random. Now, you can directly select which type of flower you'd like to plant from within the shed. Additionally, you'll notice a new selection box in the sidebar to show you your current seed choice. Any auto sellers you hire will also now hang out around the shed to pickup your harvest.

### New Looks
As I continue updating Idle Gardenâ€™s art to custom pixel art, it felt like the right time to choose a more fitting font. All in-game text now uses the Tiny 5 pixel font. Iâ€™ve also updated the buttons with new pixel art images, and Iâ€™m much happier with how they look compared to the previous design. There are still some cosmetic tweaks I want to make, though. The new design allows button images to be dynamically generated based on the length of the text. While this is convenient from a programming perspective, it does cause some issues with placement. So, for now, you might notice that some buttons donâ€™t line up perfectly or look a bit unpolished. Iâ€™ll be working on a fix for this, but I wanted to get this release out as soon as possible.

### Other Changes
- The score requirements for leveling up have been adjusted higher.
- Various sidebar labels have been removed.
- The global buy and sell buttons have also been removed from the sidebar.

Thatâ€™s all for this update! Stay tuned for more updates.

Happy gardening! ðŸŒ¼
