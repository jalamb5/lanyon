Today I've completed version 0.11 of Idle Garden, this version introduces a rudimentary scoring system and some small UI improvements:

### Scoring System Implementation
Iâ€™ve added a scoring system to the game! Now, harvesting ripe plants will earn you 2 points, while withered plants are worth 1 point. Selling plants gives a multiplier of 10, so selling 10 plants will net you 100 points. Currently, the score is just for tracking your progress, but this is a crucial first step towards future unlocks. Iâ€™m planning to introduce different plant types and maybe even pests. These will likely be tied to reaching various scoring levels, but thatâ€™s all still to be determined.

### Button Cleanup
I also took some time to clean up the buttons. I reduced the borders and vertically centered the text, making them look a bit neater. Eventually, I plan to replace these with custom images to have more control over the look, but for now, theyâ€™re much cleaner.

### Tooltip Display Adjustments
Following up on the [previous update](https://blog.justinlamb.org/2024/07/18/Devlog-Tooltips-Idle-Garden/), I made further adjustments to the tooltip display system. I removed the blue text and added a light background behind the text. Itâ€™s still not perfect, but itâ€™s definitely less jarring than the original implementation.

Thatâ€™s it for today! Stay tuned for more updates.

Happy gardening! ðŸŒ¼
