Hey everyone! Version 0.18 of [Idle Garden](https://jalamb5.itch.io/idle-garden) is now live. Todayâ€™s update is a big visual one! From the start, Iâ€™ve wanted to replace the AI-generated art used in the early releases, and with version 0.18, Idle Garden now includes only custom pixel art. As Iâ€™ve mentioned before, Iâ€™m no artist, so I wonâ€™t claim that all the art is perfect. But as I learn more about creating pixel art, Iâ€™m hopeful that things will continue to improve.

Switching to the new pixel sprites also results in more space-saving, reducing the overall game file size.

### Flower Growth Stages
Iâ€™ve also made improvements to the growth stages for flowers. It should now be much clearer when a flower is ready to be harvested. This small tweak should make gameplay a little smoother.

### Button Sprites & UI Enhancements
Thereâ€™s a minor update to the button sprites introduced in the last version, adding a slight drop shadow for better visibility. On top of that, Iâ€™ve been working on a major refactor of the UI handling system. This change will allow for more flexibility in the future, such as the new background animations youâ€™ll now see across the game.

### Bug Fixes
This version also fixes a bug related to loading, which previously caused the game to crash when shed assets were being loaded.

Thatâ€™s it for v0.18! Stay tuned for more updates.
Happy gardening! ðŸŒ¼
