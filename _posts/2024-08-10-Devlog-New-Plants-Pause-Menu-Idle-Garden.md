Hey everyone! Iâ€™m excited to share that version 0.14 of Idle Garden is now live. Hereâ€™s whatâ€™s new in this significant update:

### New Plant Sprites
When I first started developing Idle Garden, I used AI-generated art for the sake of expediency. However, itâ€™s always been my goal to move away from that. Today marks the beginning of that transition with the introduction of custom pixel art plant sprites. Iâ€™m much happier with these new sprites, and I think you will be too. The switch to a spritesheet format has also allowed for much better animations compared to the previous individual images. In the long term, I plan to transition all the gameâ€™s art to this new pixel art style. In the meantime, you might notice some conflicting styles, but this is only temporary. A big thanks to my husband Henry for stepping in to create this fantastic art!

### Pause Menu

In the [levels release](https://blog.justinlamb.org/2024/08/03/Devlog-Levels-Idle-Garden/), I added a save icon in the upper corner of the sidebar, with plans to eventually replace it with a pause button. Today, that plan comes to fruition. Clicking the new pause button brings up a menu where you can save, mute/unmute the music track, and quit the game.

### Dev Mode
Iâ€™ve also implemented a dev mode option. In past updates, Iâ€™ve accidentally released versions with testing values still active, which required a point release to fix. With dev mode, I can now test the game more thoroughly without worrying about messing up a future release. For those who want to skip ahead to an easy mode, you can access dev mode by holding down the 'd' & 'e' keys and tapping 'v'. This will give you 1000 cash, 500 seeds, and 400 scoreâ€”just be careful, as this is irreversible.

Thatâ€™s all for this update! Stay tuned for more updates.

Happy gardening! ðŸŒ¼
